        <h1>Fullstack Developer</h1>
        <p>
          A passionate and results-oriented Software Engineer based in Ghana, I
          specialize in crafting dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My
          expertise lies in leveraging modern technologies to build scalable and
          efficient solutions. I bring a strong understanding of front-end
          development with React and responsive design using Bootstrap. On the
          backend, I am proficient in building robust and scalable APIs with
          Node.js and managing data effectively with MongoDB. I am eager to
          contribute my skills to innovative projects and collaborate with
          forward-thinking teams. Explore my portfolio to see examples of my
